# Denested Nested Radical Identities

This repository is a collection of mathematically elegant denestings of nested radical expressions. These identities were found via symbolic search and numeric verification, and are formatted in LaTeX for clarity and reference.

## Motivation

The structure and symmetries of certain nested radicals allow surprising denested forms. This repository documents such identities for potential reference in symbolic computation, algebraic number theory, and mathematical exploration.

## Contents

- `discoveries/cube_root_denestings.tex`: Verified cube-root identities.
- `discoveries/parametric_identities.tex`: Closed-form instances from parametric templates.
- More to be added as exploration progresses.

## Disclaimer

This is an open-ended mathematical investigation. No formal proof system is integrated, and these results should be treated as computationally verified conjectures unless otherwise stated.
